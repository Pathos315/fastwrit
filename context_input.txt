Nudge Theory is based upon the idea that by shaping the environment, also known as the choice architecture, one can influence the likelihood that one option is chosen over another by individuals. However, one should also consider the contextual element of choice and therefore also the impact of the environment upon the consequences of that choice. In this podcast, I discuss how the context can influence the consequences of a choice in a way that is not immediately evident. In particular, the listener can easily believe that choosing one option would lead to one outcome and choosing another option would lead to another outcome. However, it is not necessarily true that this is always the case. As an example, I discuss how certain choices lead to certain outcomes even though the context is not immediately apparent.
